Fractals:

A curve or geometrical figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole.

similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth and galaxy formation.

has a Hausdorff dimension that is greater than its topological dimension (although this requirement is not met by space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve).

Hausdorff dimension:

The Hausdorff dimension of the fractal is "log N/log L"

N identical parts that are similar to the entire fractal with the scale factor of L and that the intersection between part is of the Lebesgue measure.


Techniques to generate Fractals:

> Escape time fractals — These are defined by a recurrence relation at each point in a space (such as the complex plane). Examples of this type are the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, the Burning Ship fractal and the Lyapunov fractal.

> Iterated function systems — These have a fixed geometric replacement rule. Cantor set, Sierpinski carpet, Sierpinski gasket, Peano curve, Koch snowflake, Harter-Heighway dragon curve, T-Square, Menger sponge, are some examples of such fractals.

> Random fractals — Generated by stochastic rather than deterministic processes, for example, trajectories of the Brownian motion, Lévy flight, fractal landscapes and the Brownian tree. The latter yields so-called mass- or dendritic fractals, for example, diffusion-limited aggregation or reaction-limited aggregation clusters.


Classification of fractals:

> Exact self-similarity
> Quasi-self-similarity
> Statistical self-similarity 


Examples:

A Julia set, a fractal related to the Mandelbrot set.

A relatively simple class of examples is given by the Cantor sets, Sierpinski triangle and carpet, Menger sponge, dragon curve, space-filling curve, Koch curve. Additional examples of fractals include the Lyapunov fractal and the limit sets of Kleinian groups. Fractals can be deterministic (all the above) or stochastic (that is, non-deterministic). For example the trajectories of the Brownian motion in the plane have Hausdorff dimension 2.

Chaotic dynamical systems are sometimes associated with fractals. Objects in the phase space of a dynamical system can be fractals. Objects in the parameter space for a family of systems may be fractal as well. An interesting example is the Mandelbrot set. 

This set contains whole discs, so it has the "Hausdorff dimension equal to its topological dimension of 2" —but what is truly surprising is that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set also has the Hausdorff dimension of 2 
(while the topological dimension of 1), a result proved by M. Shishikura in 1991. A closely related fractal is the Julia set.
